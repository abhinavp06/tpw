After finishing my Sabbath review, I have been trying to figure out what direction I want steer this blog in. I went through so many iterations which I'll explain below:
<br/><br/>
See in my opinion, the key to unlocking a "higher meaning" is to categorize thinking into 3 categories - God, Consciousness and The Self. 
<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li> When I was initially designing this website, I thought of categorizing blogs into these 3 categories. Infact, I had prepared a mind map like this:
<br/><br/>
![Mind Map](albums/album-003/reviews/mind-map-pre-review.png)
<br/><br/>
The idea was that I would maintain hyperlinks to blogs in various sections. The bottom half of the map would be divided into 3 parts for each of the 3 pillars where I would explore these topics individually. The top half would be divided into 4 parts - 3 pairs of pillars and 1 group which would explore them all at once. However, I have realized that this approach is too mechanical. When you think about anything, relations among the pillars build up in an instant. Therefore, I have decided to just maintain a linear blog series where I will just talk about these 3 topics. I may sometimes explore a topic individually and sometimes explore them in pairs or even all 3 at once. I think this is easier to follow for you as well.
<br/><br/>
I thought I would explore the topic of "God" with criticism, "Consciousness" with curiosity and "The Self" with love and a human touch. It was a nice concept, but I think maintaining a nice blend of these pillars is the most humane way for me to proceed.</li><br/>
<li> Another approach I had explored was using playlists instead of albums. However, I felt that it is too "quick". Nowadays, it's so easy to hop between songs in an instant due to short form content being at it's peak. I absolutely hate the fact that a lot of people seem to have forgotten and a lot of younger people (including people my age) don't know how to appreciate the art of making an album.
<br/><br/>
The best way to actually understand an artist is to listen to their albums and discography. It is literally their own mental, artistic growth mapped out for you to see. The evolution of man if I may.</li></ul>
I have also come up with a framework to work on these topics which I believe will keep evolving as time passes. I have decided that for now it is better to review 1 album in a month. This will give me time to actually think and then jot it down here.
<br/><br/>
With the first 2 blogs I was trying to find my footing in this unknown space. While I do believe what I'm creating is the first of it's kind, in the end what matters is the substance, i.e, what I eventually end up writing.
<br/><br/>
So, to summarize, we will think of this series like a stream of water - dipping in and out of the stream while some really beautiful music plays in the background.
<br/><br/>
I also plan on keeping this github repository public with all branches as it is so that I can revisit my changes later. It's nerdy but I know I will enjoy looking back at it several years from now. Here's the repository if you're interested: [tpw](https://github.com/abhinavp06/tpw)
<br/><br/>
With that said, I now want to introduce you to one of the greatest albums to ever exist - Ænema.
<br/><br/>
_There will never be another Ænema._
