Professionally, I am a software engineer and an architect. I absolutely love the field of computer science. It allows me to be more dynamic with my ideas compared to something like painting which is static. This is also probably the reason why I gravitate towards music and movies more. There is fluidity of thought. Stillness can be interpreted in many ways but to be able to generate multiple versions of stillness gives rise to even more ways of interpretation.

We talked about "conflicts" in the previous chapters. Let's try to build a new sorting algorithm by using the ideology of "conflict" as a base. Let's just go all out and build the most impractical sorting algorithm to ever exist. Here's the [Grok chat](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_24875daf-e178-4b8f-9508-d6199328bb3b) if you're interested.
<br/><br/>
Some considerations:
<ul>
<li>We will only deal with real integers</li>
<li>We will not optimize for time but for completion</li>
<li>Try to come up with a way to group numbers together</li>
</ul>
So, the idea is that we will receive an array of real integers. This can be infinitely long but let's assume we are receiving a solvable length. Now, these integers have different types of relationships with each other. Think of it as a group of people with different ideologies but having some overlap with each other. We need to:
<ul>
<li>Define a layer which works on grouping such integers</li>
<li>Define a layer which then interprets these groups and predicts the best way to sort them</li>
</ul>
If you're interested, please read the Grok chat to discover how I'm currently using AI in my solution & development process. It's so fun and has definitely increased my efficiency.
<br/><br/>
Whenever I'm given a problem to solve, I follow a roadmap that I have come up with after experimenting with a lot of AI tools in the last few months:
<ul> 
<li>I first spend a few hours going back and forth with an AI (experimenting with Grok 4 nowadays) to first plan out what I want to build</li>
<li>I then export the chat to a readme file and then create a new project in VS Code.</li>
<li>I then create a directory called "docs" which consists of multiple sub-directories like "usecase", "architecture", "design" (if there is UI involved), etc.</li>
<li>Then I ask Copilot ("Ask" mode) to analyse the directories.</li>
<li>Then I switch to the "Agent" mode to start implementing code.</li>
</ul>
Usually, if the problem is simple, this is more than enough. When we dive into more complex problems I tend to add another sub-directory called "discussions" which contains readme files containing MOMs and notes I take after discussing the problem with my colleagues.
<br/><br/>
I'm making an assumption that the bigger the number, the more conflicts it has. When a more disturbed patient walks into a psychiatrist's office, the psychiatrist needs to dissect each and every property of this person to a greater extent compared to someone who doesn't have a lot of problems in their life.
<br/><br/>
Now, if the positive numbers indicate a higher degree of conflict, what can the negative numbers mean?
<br/><br/>
I'm going to pause at this point for now. A fun and cool side project. Who cares if it works or doesn't? The amount of fun you can have by creating something even if it's the most absurd idea you can think of is unmatched.
<br/><br/>
If we're all creations of something bigger, imagine the amount of intellect that entity must have. We can't even think of the scale.
<br/><br/>
I'd like to talk about the importance of audio equipment when listening to music. If you're really into music there are 2 things that you always need to keep in mind:
<ul>
<li>The audio source</li>
<li>Your listening equipment</li>
</ul>
I currently use the Letshuoer S12 Pro with a custom EQ profile along with a DAC which is ample to power this set of IEMs. If you read my previous reviews you will notice that I tend to describe how the sound "feels". You can visualise a lot of things if you invest in good equipment.
<br/><br/>
I'll expand on this in the upcoming song "Pushit" as it is one of the best songs by Tool.
