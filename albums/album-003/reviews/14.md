Ions are a physical representation of conflict. The acceptance of conflict. :)

Let's all be pretentious cunts for a few minutes.
<br/><br/>
That white noise that you listen to is the ever present consciousness. That buzz that is moving in circles around your ears is the rise of something. It keeps getting louder and louder but then it stops. It begins. It stops. A cycle. However, the white noise is present throughout. If you acknowledge the existence of this noise, you will realise it gets louder and louder.
<br/><br/>
Can the buzzing electrical sound be a sonical representation of thought? Of conflict?
<br/><br/>
What is that third effect which we can hear in the end? Sounds like speech. There is also a new synth that is introduced. What does it mean?
