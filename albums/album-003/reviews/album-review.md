Was the album not cool? As I said earlier, it is such a "grand" experience. From the beautiful vocals, to the guitars producing sound in harmony and of course, Danny's energetic drums. What a fun album to listen to! If I could only listen to 1 Tool album, this would be it.

I think we have discovered a lot in this review. However, we still need to think about how "space" is created and perceived with this new train of thought. An abstract concept like time is easier to relate but I haven't put a lot of thought towards "space". We also seemed to have dipped our toes into human emotions such as "ego" and "love". This is something I would like to explore as well. I really want to explore how biological processes can be explained using this new theory that we have come up with.

Another thing I would love to explore is the field on quantum physics. If we can agree that consciousness is connected down to every single atomic and subatomic particle, maybe we can explain the reasonings behind the famous slit experiment and how something can exist at multiple places at the same instant.

I'm assuming you are here after I finally decided to share this blog online. Do follow me on my socials (you can find them on the homepage) as I would love to gather more ideas and listen to other perspectives.
