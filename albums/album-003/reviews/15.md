Okay, sit tight. You're about to "experience" music. Make sure that you listen with the best equipment you have.
<br/><br/>
As we have reached the last song in Tool's ultimate creation and have finally reached the point where you will witness Tool at their peak, I have a very controversial opinion (or rather I think it is) that I want to state here - <b>the current way of primary formal education is one of the worst ways to learn.</b>
<br/><br/>
Every single person starts really thinking only when they truly are ready to. The exact instant when one gains real exposure to the world outside is when it all begins.
<br/><br/>
With institutions, we have built this isolated world. The teacher and the books they read are nothing but a facade. It's an account of the world through someone's eyes.
<br/><br/>
Why? Why is it that when a young child chooses/is forced to be a doctor or an engineer, they are made unaware about the remaining parts of society? Even the fact that these are the only 2 professions that I could list from the top of my head aids my argument.
<br/><br/>
Why must one be denied art? Why must one be denied psychology? Why must one be denied any sorts of exposure to skills as basic as cooking or cleaning?
<br/><br/>
If you're an art student why should you be denied access to the beauty in the existence of various engineering creations such as a message queue, a cache or a database? Why should you not know about what a gear ratio is or why integration is an important concept in mathematics? Why should you not know about thermodynamics or Newton's laws? If you're a history student or a religious scholar, why should you be denied access to the various biological processes that exist in our body? Why are you denied a path towards financial knowledge? Why must a scholar not know about business? What about sports, fitness, martial arts?
<br/><br/>
Yes of course, I acknowledge that the basic premise of an educational institution is to make someone an expert in a particular field and it is not the job of the institution to teach them about other things. But why must an institution be limited? Why can't it be boundless? Why do we even need educational institutions? When you look at the world, where does one have the free time to get exposed to these other things? And even when they do, why do they just try to escape from their monotonous routine and not actually pick up something cool? Why do we no longer sketch for fun? Why do we no longer just run around? Why do we no longer spend more time together as one? I hate it. It's all conflict.
<br/><br/>
Ask the average Indian today if they know why Indian classical music is an example of intellectualism and engineering at it's peak.Â Ask anyone about the filmmakers that influenced Bollywood and other movie industries they love today. Ask them why they don't see the importance of fields like carpentry or plumbing. Ask them about why the value of life in this country is so little. In fact, just ask them about the people around them. This is not only the case with Indians but anyone in the world.
<br/><br/>
They just can't answer. In fact, I can't answer a lot of questions like those either. There is no point in being pretentious. We have all been dumbed down and have lost the sense of 'oneness'. All due to years and years of conditioning. Now, the funny thing is that every single person rants about this yet we don't change. And then come people who point out this exact thing however, we still don't try to change. We may agree for a moment or two but then we go back to our old life because we find psychological security in it.
<br/><br/>
And then when one dives deeper into thinking about anything, they are suddenly shaken. They can "realise" conflict.
<br/><br/>
Although, I also do think that everyone should pursue a higher form of education in a field of their choice if they have the privilige of not worrying about money. Being part of an institution which can provide total freedom to focus on a particular field with like-minded (and ofcourse conflicting thinking) individuals is the best way to grow. Research is a very important field in our society. Only when we accept the idea of wanting to pursue more and more knowledge is when we will be able to progress and move towards a better society.
<br/><br/>
There are so many reforms I would like in the Indian education system. Even the mere shadow cast by the vast amounts of history and knowledge that has existed in this beautiful country is enough to create a better and a more intellectual society. The biggest change I would want in our education system is a path which creates more students in any field regardless of their age. We can talk about engineering, medicine, business, art, religion as a career but how many people actually dive deeper into it?
<br/><br/>
If you're an engineer, have you ever built something just because it was fun and not because your job demanded it? Have you ever thought about the underlying architecture of the LLMs or other types of models that you use daily? If you're a doctor have you ever questioned why is it that a DNA strand exists or why the common cold exists? If you're an art student have you ever questioned why the artist of the famous "Dancing Girl" statue built it? If you're a history student, have you every asked why Mohenjodaro was so important?
<br/><br/>
I beleive when one is small, parents must answer each and every "why" "what" and "how" their child has. No matter their gender, sexuality, generational history or any other stupid factor.
<br/><br/>
And the only way to achieve this is by one generation deciding to all come to a realisation that a smarter society that lives in harmony is much greater than the world designed by conflict. And when we all collectively start thinking better, we progress.
<br/><br/>
Yes, this is something that everyone thinks of when they're quite young. This is not some ground-breaking observation that has been unearthed. Yet, why can't we break ourselves from our current state even though everyone has the same thought?
<br/><br/>
A big argument against all this philosophical bullshit (pardon my French) is "so what?" And you know what? They're right in a lot of ways. If society can live in harmony and blah blah blah, so what? There would be no purpose in life. Imagine living in a society which is harmonious all the time. There would be 0 "progress". Well, not until one person begins their conflict. They question everything and suddenly we're all aboard on this speeding train to the new way of life. I think this is why I get the idea of reincarnation. 
<br/><br/>
Either way, why not give it a chance? Maybe it actually will be a better way of life.
<br/><br/>
Now, with that statement, did you notice another example of "conflict"?
<br/><br/>
The fact that we can observe "something" produces a "thought" in "the self" which creates "conflict" but this thought itself arises from a conflict within the self only when they are in conflict with other people's thoughts who themseleves are in conflict means that we are able to observe that the observer is the observed. We are able to observe that we are all one. And this not only applies across the human race but other things on this planet too. If I like to eat meat but can also observe this then that means I am observing myself in conflict (and in the social world - hypocritical) with something that exists in this world (you can replace it with "reality" if you want a more dramatic realisation) which apparently is the same as you and everything else that exists (even the unknown).
<br/><br/>
And as I said earlier, if we all can impart this vision in a child as early as possible, not now, maybe not even in a 1000 years, but someday (yes, I know the difference between "someday" and "some day") there will be a much better society. And this is only possible if we all take collective action in reforming the education that our children receive. One must not be exposed to thinking only if they reach a prestigious institution.
<br/><br/>
However, I think the true nature of consciousness will never allow this.
<br/><br/>
_"Well, not until one person begins their conflict"._
<br/><br/>
I mentioned this earlier. When I think about the role of "God" in this, this is the best definition I can give. We seemed to have made up this entity who produced (or rather witnessed) the first thought. Spiritual people say that consciousness is ever present. So, does consciousness have a favourite "consciousness" to which it imparts the first ever conflict or rather witness the first conflict? That means is their conflict within the ever present consciousness itself? It's endless. It's like _anincomprehensiblenumbertothepowerofanincrompehensiblenumbertothepowerof...._-dimension. Absolutely unimaginable. Maybe that dimension could be "God". The theory of everything in a pretentious and preachy sense, I must say.
<br/><br/>
And if you pick apart my arguments and go to their roots, you will find that there is an element of "conditioning" that exists. I am connecting all of this to consciousness more and God less. A religious person would do it the other way around. A person who is stuck in the middle would never even come to this conclusion because they never think but the funny thing is - God is nothing but a conflict which is created by the need for psychological security in us. I find some leeway to live my life in this dumbed down state as I know I have a backup. And the fact that I can realise this by observing THE consciousness while also accepting I am part of this consciousness means, surprise surprise, the observer is the observed. Now whether God is the ultimate consciousness or not is a different question. I don't think we can ever say with total clarity what the actual fact is. It is just not possible objectively.
<br/><br/>
Religion in it's truest sense is absolutely brilliant. It is only a pathway to realisation if you can think first. And who am I to define what the "truest sense" is? Who am I to define what the truth is? These are my beliefs and one can only form their own when they take the time out to think. You will find a lot of gaps in my analogies, my blogs, the way I think and guess what? That is good! That means you are able to think but eventually you too may come to a conclusion about my ideologies of "conflict" as this thought only exists when you think and establish some sort of conflict with what I write due to your conditioning. 
<br/><br/>
This is also why I quite like the idea of reincarnation. It makes so much sense. It takes numerous years for us to all finally come in unison and discard conflict as a whole. But at the same time, it is possible that this is never achieved. So, either time exists or we are all in a standstill and conflict is what perceives time.
<br/><br/>
Now is conflict a thought of consciousness or does conflict give rise to thought? Maybe this is also how time can be defined. Creation of thought or creation of conflict creates time. Is this "realisation" in itself? Is time actually non existent? This realisation itself is a figment of my imagination. Is there no realisation at all? If so, then what is the point? This all keeps going on and on in a loop due to a thought which itself is risen by conflict only when we actually have a thought. Are thought and conflict one? 
<br/><br/>
Why should we accept that consciousness is ever present? How can we prove it? The whole base of my argument is built upon the assumption that consciousness is ever present. Why? Why should I believe this? How can we say, without any doubt, that it is ever present?
<br/><br/>
Is the path to realisation only unlocked when we accept certain things? Why must I accept this statement and not that God is the ultimate entity? This, I think is the definition of being agnostic. Do we need to accept that something just "is"? Ever present in an unthinkable way and we can choose the path to either think about it or go to a higher level and just participate in society and it's norms? Is the thought of accepting that something just exists and we must just live not observing conflict? Is this not thought itself which has been produced by our consciousness?
<br/><br/>
Conflict is the natural order of life. It is the reasoning behind existence of anything. Only when we can dissolve all conflict do we find "eternal peace".
<br/><br/>
What an interesting observation.
