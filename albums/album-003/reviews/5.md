What is "consciousness"?
<br/><br/>
I know I keep sounding like a broken record but when we analyse things, it is given that we will revisit certain questions.
<br/><br/>
Let's try to put it in a different way. After I go for a beer run with my friends, I am happy. Why? I am experiencing some change in my mental state due to my actions. Now is happiness created by my actions or is it just something that exists and we experience it? Either way are we not experiencing conflict within ourselves? Conflict within the "normal" state of the self and this happiness.
<br/><br/>
When we separate ourselves from this experience as we analyse it, are we not "experiencing" consciousness? Some series of actions bring about a change in the self. There is some sort of beauty in it. All of a sudden when we put our thinking caps on, we have moved out of our body and are generating thought without the self. Of course, we are still using our brain and what not, but can you not SEE the separation? I frankly don't know how else to put it.
<br/><br/>
Now, when I examine this, is it me who is examining this or is it consciousness which is observing itself? We are again doing circles around "the observer is the observed" statement that we encountered earlier.
<br/><br/>
Is consciousness made up of multiple layers? If you have been thinking along as you read, you will agree that we are able to experience this moment of clarity at a surface level. We're able to familiarise ourselves with these abstract concepts. We need to dive even deeper to understand the true nature.
<br/><br/>
But is there a true nature? Are there really layers? What if when we do reach the deepest layer we find out that this imagination itself was part of consciousness? Can we even objectively, scientifically and psychologically define consciousness? I'm assuming this is what _panpsychism_ means.
<br/><br/>
I can't stop myself from thinking about the basis of quantum physics where certain things can have multiple values/positions, etc. as we come to this realisation. Is it physically possible for us to exist in two places at the same time? We seem to be able to realise this as we analyse the self from outside ourselves.
<br/><br/>
Let's explore this in a different way.
<br/><br/>
There is a word for a very euphoric yet depressing feeling - _nostalgia_
<br/><br/>
Who doesn't think about the past? Every single person does. There are memories stored inside our brain. We cling onto them. Now, as we established some sort of "experience" earlier, is a memory not an experience itself? It is. So, if I can relive this memory then that means I am able to travel back to an "experience". Experiencing time in a different way. It is only when we can somehow separate ourselves from our physical sense we are able to relive experiences. What a beautiful system the brain is.
<br/><br/>
As we relive the experience again, we are again observing ourselves which existed in a different moment.
<br/><br/>
I'm going to prompt Grok to help me find resources which can explain further. You can find the link to the Grok chat in my "notes" section [note-001](https://tpw.co.in/note-article.html?path=notes%2Fnote-001).
<br/><br/>
I have stumbled upon these articles: 
<ul>
<li>[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Consciousness](https://iep.utm.edu/consciousness/).</li>
<li>[Quantum Mechanics and the puzzle of human consciousness](https://alleninstitute.org/news/quantum-mechanics-and-the-puzzle-of-human-consciousness/)</li>
<li>[Panpsychism](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/pan_seager.pdf)</li>
<li>[Panpsychism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/)</li>
</ul>
I will read them and update this chapter with my findings.

In the 3rd article, there is this statement:
<br/>
_"For example, we say that an electron has a negative charge of about 1.6x10^-19 coulombs, but what this means is that the electron is disposed to move in such-and-such a way in an electric field of such-and-such a strength. The intrinsic nature of electric charge remains utterly mysterious. And yet it seems reasonable to think that every dispositional property stems from underlying intrinsic properties. Of these, with respect to the fundamental physical constituents of the world, we know absolutely nothing, since physics deals only with the dispositional properties of matter. This is a long standing position. Both Eddington and Russell, among others, agree that ‘science has nothing to say as to the intrinsic nature of the atom’(Russell called the dispositional properties of matter ‘mathematical properties’). This led Eddington to assert further that we know nothing of atoms which ‘renders it at all incongruous that they should constitute a thinking object’ (1927, 259 [both quotations]) and to adopt a panpsychist understanding of matter."_
<br/><br/>
Obviously a scientific mystery. Why is it that the electric field behaves this way? The question here is not about an orbital but about the intrinsic nature of it. This is the true unknown. This also reminds me of the statement I had made in a [chapter](https://tpw.co.in/track-review.html?album=albums%2Falbum-002&track=5) of my Sabbath review - "What makes water wet?"
<br/><br/>
Is the nature of our own thinking and consciousness so limited that we are not allowed to find out why a certain thing has an intrinsic property? Do we have to accept something just "is"?
<br/><br/>
Fun stuff. I think you should go through these articles.
<br/><br/>
I love this guitar section which comes in around 3.41. The whole theme of this song revolves around ascending to a higher consciousness. I understand the whole theme of this blog and this review may seem very pretentious but is it not interesting to be pretentious? To think in a different way?
<br/><br/>
Is it possible for us to change our thought process so that instead of questioning if there is a single consciousness we question it the other way around - "Why is it that consciousness would be separated? Why is it that we think there are multiple consciousness?". If we go ahead with this, it opens up a new way of analysing things. We are able to somehow discard the "self" in a way.
