I was recently listening to some of Prabha Atre's recordings. Her voice is so beautiful. Why is it that we tend to like something so much? Why is it that we tend to like something more than another thing? At what point does this "like" turn to "love"? What is "love"?
<br/><br/>
It is quite a vulnerable emotion, or rather, a state of being. There seems to be this innate ability in us to always prefer something/someone. Why? Of course, conflict is the reasoning but on a human level, why?
<br/><br/>
If you question the fundamentals of your relationship with anyone, can you come to a conclusion that it's because of wanting some sort of security? 
<br/><br/>
The same people we have conflict with also provide security. How? Is this not conflict itself?
