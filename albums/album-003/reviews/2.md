I watched all the videos. I have been listeninig to this particular one for the past 3 hours on loop - [How does one negate the 'I' without suppression | J. Krishnamurti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRNmh1zVFgE). J. Krishnamurti's explanations seem to have brought some sort of a moment of clarity in me.
<br/><br/>
I'm going to pause this review for a while and try to go deeper into my findings. I'm first going to start by creating the doubt in myself. I mean, really creating one. I will keep on updating my notes file with timestamps as I dig deeper.
<br/><br/>
Please keep in mind that we are not introducing a bias here. We are simply exploring a new form of thinking. Just because J. Krishnamurti says something does not mean it is true no matter how intellectual he was. We will think for ourselves and arrive to conclusions. All these videos are just starting points which we can use to form our own train of thought.

There are many categories one can choose to work on after realisation : realisation (diving deeper?), thinking about more abstract concepts (how does the world exist, what is time, etc.), human feelings (conflict), self improvement.
<br/><br/>
The path to all of this can only be guided by a realisation of some sense.
<br/><br/>
It's funny how I talked about not introducing a bias but Mr. K's words seem to have helped a lot. Maybe this bias of confirmation that these words may help me "realise" is also perhaps a conflict of it's own. What if I am moving towards wanting to "realise"? We need to understand how to just stay still.
<br/><br/>
The pipeline seems to be very clear to me (I may be wrong ofcourse):
<br/>
<ol>
<li> You first dive deeper into the simplest of things (when you begin, you can only understand this intellectually. You cannot actually see it).</li>
<li> You should then question who is experiencing this realisation? This I beleive will help aid the process of actual realisation.</li>
<li>You then look into yourself. When you start the journey with an abstract concept with the goal of realisation, there is no emotion attached to it apart from curiosity. You don't actually realise. When one looks into themselves is when one realises how they could possibly be connected to something unified.</li>
<li>We should then dive a little into the metaphysical realm and try to grasp concepts of time, space, etc. We should also explore "oneness" here again.</li>
<li>Once we can successfully dissect ourselves, we have 3 paths we can take: explore the "human" emotions which also leads to coming up with reasons for things happening in the world around us, the metaphysical realm where we try to realise how is it that something is existing in the same plane as we are (also the relationship with time & more abstract concepts), and the last being self improvement - how can I apply my findings to my own life?</li>
</ol>
I think these 5 points are solid pillars which can help build a castle of knowledge. This also can be considered a roadmap - quite mechanical but let's see if this helps. We need to allot more time towards  thinking. We can see all of this intellectually, even right now but merely listening to people and reading books will not actually help in realising. We need to actually observe.

<br/><br/>
For the past 2 days, I have been thinking about the "doubt" in me which pushed me into this path quite some time back.
<br/><br/>
The question I keep asking myself is - "Why do you want to know anything?"
<br/><br/>
When you think about it, what is the need? What does one possibly achieve after they "realise"? Forgive me if I sound like a preacher but these texts are a reflection of my curiosity (or are they?).
<br/><br/>
What is "purpose"? 
<br/><br/>
If one says that they are content with their lives, then what is their purpose? Is it to maintain this state of happiness? If that is the case, then there still is the human desire in them to continue clinging onto this state. This means that a person's purpose is to maintain their psychological security.
<br/><br/>
If I were to look inside myself.. I stated that I am quite content with the life I have. This obviously cannot be entirely true. If that truly was the case, I wouldn't have any reason to live. Maybe I'm curious about this field because deep down there is a desire in me to "reach a higher state of being". This desire simply has to exist.
<br/><br/>
On a higher level when one talks about competitiveness, self growth, love, money, success and whatever other term you can think of, is it not all driven by desire?
<br/><br/>
If you're born in a poor household, your purpose is found in the act of lifting yourself up socially and monetarily. If you're born in a richer household, free from worries of the current social statutes, you focus on more abstract levels of purpose, a higher meaning, if I may.
<br/><br/>
When one talks about love it is because they either feel lonely, are driven by lust or cling onto that magical feeling that you get being with someone (which ofcourse is still psychological security. I will dive deeper into these emotions once we dive deeper into ourselves).
<br/><br/>
This same love can be projected onto religion as well. Sometimes people use religion to "cancel out" their wrongdoings too.
<br/><br/>
My apologies if I make any "controversial" statements, however please bear in mind that anything I say is not a statement but a question. I may assert something but it is my job to question myself and find out the truth according to me. 
<br/><br/>
Now, all these concepts are very easy to see. A lot of my findings are thoughts I have already come across long back. However, the goal here is to actually realise them and dive deeper.
<br/><br/>
3 thoughts I have by extending my previous statement:
<ul>
<li>Is the purpose to reach a higher state existent in all of us? Objectively.</li>
<li>Is the purpose to reach a higher state just a lie that we have created and we have been conditioned to believe it? Does this mean that we can somehow define our purpose which can then reflect across the mindsets of numerous people throughout time? (Yes, yes, this is me flirting with more abstract concepts of time and the metaphysical realm in general).</li>
<li>Extending onto the second point and referring to the "rich and poor" analogy earlier, is purpose driven by conditioning in the social world - where of course, the social world is made by us and infact is us.</li>
</ul>
These are very tricky questions.
<br/><br/>
"Eulogy" fits so well as I write this. There is no doubt that there is "ego" involved while creating this blog. There is this small portion of me which thinks that if I ever do realise all of this, I may be perceived as an intellectual individual. Maybe, people would praise me. Sure, I may deny this feeling but we both know it exists. On a surface level, it doesn't matter to me if anyone reads this or not. However, if I look inside, there is this ego which in fact causes me to publish my findings and share it with everyone.
<br/><br/>
Another observation is that while there is ego, there is also vulnerability. If this blog exists because of ego, it also exists because of vulnerability. My thoughts are open to the public. We usually protect our thoughts yet this I beleive is one of the highest forms of vulnerability. Now, is there also ego which wrote the previous line? I don't know.
<br/><br/>
Maybe a part of my psychological security is made up of ego. However, there obviously is an analytical layer in me which can recognise this. Maybe this is what the preachers and religions mean when they talk about conflict. 
<br/><br/>
So, is pupose driven by conflicts within the self?
<br/><br/>
This reddit post: [Complete Dissection of Eulogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolBand/s/uabLezdbbY) also seems to indicate people have had similar findings.
<br/><br/>
Can we please talk about Maynard's scream here near the end of the song? Some of my favourite Maynard screams are on this album. Another song that I always listen to is "Ticks & Leeches". Those 2 introductory screams are so good!
