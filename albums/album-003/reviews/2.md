I watched all the videos. I have been listeninig to this particular one for the past 3 hours on loop - [How does one negate the 'I' without suppression | J. Krishnamurti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRNmh1zVFgE). J. Krishnamurti's explanations seem to have brought some sort of a moment of clarity in me.
<br/><br/>
I'm going to pause this review for a while and try to go deeper into my findings. I'm first going to start by creating the doubt in myself. I mean, really creating one.
