What is "birth"? Why does a child cry when they're born? Have we left something that we previously enjoyed which we miss? We can't recall the present at that moment, rather, realise the present. It's a beautiful process. The process of life. The beginning (or continuation of something?).

If you read through the lyrics of the album, you will see that this track has been placed perfectly. We are beginning to think in a different way. A new train of thought.

Very cool!
