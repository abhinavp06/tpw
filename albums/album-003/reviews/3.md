If one were to ask me why I don't dive into the socio-political topics, here's my answer:
<ul>
<li>One truth that I have ultimately accepted is that there is ego inside me to a certain degree. Being pretentious and talking about these abstract concepts fills my ego. It generates this perception of myself to be "different" from other people.</li>
<li>Let's take a simple example: "War is bad". Now I could go on and on about different wars in history and maybe even the ongoing wars currently. However, what I am interested in is not the outcome but the reasoning for their existence.</li>
</ul>
Let's expand a bit on the second point:
<br/><br/>
Suppose we are in a podcast. I am the host and you're my guest and there's a crew responsible for recording the podcast. I say "I am the most enlightened person in this room". Quite egoistical, obviously. I can visualise and see it intellectually that there is a "conflict" within me to separate myself from you and the crew - which creates the "self" (or maybe the self creates this conflict. I will have to look into it). Now, this conflict hurts you and the crew. It maybe even hurts your ego (it does. This is a fact). The cameraman who has about 20 years of experience is suddenly questioned about their abilities. You, as a guest are questioned about your intellect. This hurts your ego and your "self". Now, when this goes on and on repeatedly for a long time, it creates more tension and hence, more conflict. Eventually it reaches to a point where there is a "war" between us.
<br/><br/>
So, to reiterate - I can see why "war is bad" but I am more interested in figuring out why the atomic elements which lead to the conditions of war exist (and their relationship with one another) rather than dissecting the outcome of war's existence on a social level. This may sound confusing, but this is the best way I can put it for now. I want to dive deeper, go lower into these problems and not stay at a higher level.

With the current situation going on in my country, there has been a desire to consume more Indian art and history. I discard the current state of India, mentally. So much turmoil but for what? Why are we so divisive? This is not only true in humans but also in animals and other life forms. Why is the default nature of the world constantly in a state of conflict? Is conflict a necessity in life? From the electrons in an atom to the various countries we all live in, there is nothing but pure conflict.
<br/><br/>
When does one decide that this is enough? When will we give up on establishing an "I"?
<br/><br/>
It's an interesting observation. Imagine there is a small island and two people have just been dropped into existence on this island. Initially, they get along really well. They hunt, roam around. At night, when they sleep, one man wakes up and decides to steal the boat and leave for a "better place" even though he doesn't know if it exists. However, he's unsuccessful. These attempts carry on for a few days but then the man gives up. Due to conflicts in himself, he has set the table for future conflicts. Naturally, as he spends his days with the other man, he starts becoming meaner and meaner. One day the other man decides that this is it and he tries to go steal the boat in the middle of the night. In doing so the man wakes up and notices the other man stealing the boat. The man gets angry and attacks the other man. He eventually kills the other man. However, there comes a huge tide which ends up sweeping this boat away. The man now has to die and has lost his only way of human interaction.
<br/><br/>
Conflict within ourselves, I believe, gives rise to greater conflicts. This is an elemental thought. Everyone knows this. It is so simple to see but when you apply it to every little thought that you have, you will see that anything always exists due to conflict. The realisation is that conflict is a vital part of our existence.
<br/><br/>
"Why does water turn to gas when heated?"
<br/>
"Why do I love someone?"
<br/>
"Why do I not like the colour "blue"?"
<br/><br/>
In fact, the simple reasoning for art's existence is conflict. Everything is art. Everything is conflict.
<br/><br/>
As we make these observations, we realise that we are dissecting ourselves. Observing ourselves. Can this be the first step in us realising that the "observer is the observed"?
<br/><br/>
In fact, we have discovered the sense of "self" as well. I examine myself and state that these emotions are something I feel. This means the "I" experiences something. The self is distancing itself from the same feeling that is caused by it's own conflict. How cool is that? 
<br/><br/>
Now the questions that come into picture -
<ul>
<li>We need to dive deeper into "Is the self different from the observer?" How else can we confirm that "the observer is the observed"?</li>
<li>Where is "God" in all of this?</li>
