You know what? You really gotta give it to these guys. I can't possibly imagine being the creator of something new altogether. How does one possibly just conceive a new thought, a new sound? Is the art in the tempo? The vocal scales? The guitars piercing your ears in an unfamiliar manner? Or the drums sounding a different way? These 4 human beings thought of it themselves and then combined together to form something even greater. Is the key to creation of something new dependent on individuality or collective consciousness?

Let me look it up.

Until then, let's talk about the world today. Quite a lot of wars around us. India Pakistan, Israel Palestine, ongoing Ukraine Russia and now recently Thailand and Cambodia. It always blows my mind how a lot of destruction is associated with religion. I don't know how something can contain such opposite elements. The difference between the peak and the trough is incomprehensible. A fun relationship that I like to draw is how different subgenres are like the different stages of a religion? You can also find the same in a single artist's discography as well. For example, the Layne era of Alice in Chains. They started off with a totally different sound and then when we got the self-titled album, we knew it was over. Just like what this song represents. Doom. 

Btw, the album release date being 1 day before Valentine's day is quite funny. 

Let's go back to the previous topic.

So, I read this paper: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.713445/full

For John-Steiner, “humans come into being and mature in relation to others” (2000, p. 187, John-Steiner's italics). Collaboration thus “…provides a mutual zone of proximal development where participants can increase their repertory of cognitive and emotional expression”.

So, as John-Steiner defines 4 collaboration patterns: distributed, complementary, family, and integrative, she states that the four patterns are not necessarily hierarchical but actually part of a single creative work and serve different puprposes. Honestly, it's like a paradox. Collaborations themselves are collaborations of collaborations. Think about it. 

This is such a pro connected-consciousness argument in a way. Hinduism was so ahead of it's time.

I remember watching this video by Swami Sarvapriyananda - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n6NvDpcwLM

Consciousness is not a thought of your body and mind, but it's outside the body itself. It is not a part of the body. However, consciousness seems to be an entity which cannot be realised without our body and mind either. He draws comparisons with light. How it can illuminate a hand but how it also exists even if it cannot be realised (such as in a room with nothing).

"What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no"

What an iconic vocal entry.

They really nailed this sound.

After watching this video as well by the great J. Krishnamurti - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5WMzoK6IpY

I quite like the approach of not being professionals while trying to understand such topics. It basically removes this invisible barrier of having to be correct. Perhaps, this is my goal here as well. I want to raise questions in search of answers. Maybe there are certain things that we just don't understand enough.

At around 7.30 in the video, he states that the brain is conditioned and limited to the knowledge all around us but to discover something new altogether (basically conceiving something new), we need to enquire the infinite unknown. This means that the brain has infinite capacity but is limited to what we have conditioned it to.

So, to think about it. Is it possible for the brain to be free of the known? If we think about this, we need to establish a distinction between the brain and the mind.

It reminds me of the scene in "2001: A Space Odyssey" where the ape realises what weapons are. The scene has an ungodly amount of intensity. You can literally visualize a new thought. Stanley Kubrick was soo good!

How's the song? I hope you're liking it. Imagine hearing this for the first time in 1970. I wish I was alive back then. Fucking phenomenal.

A fun fact: You can hear the iconic chord progression in Megadeth's song Good Mourning / Black Friday as well (around 4.01-4.05).

"Big black shape with eyes of fire
Tellin' people their desire
Satan's sittin' there, he's smilin'
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me"

Sabbath talks about how they're being confronted by Satan himself. Clearly, the birth of doom metal.

I like Bill's gentleness with the drums. They're so calculated and he knows exactly how to manipulate the "feeling" and "intensity" of doom itself.

Butler and Ozzy work so well together. The difference between the sounds they produce in terms of depth and shrill can also represent how we can often be very vocal about our downfall yet the internal feeling that we experience is too deep.

After these 2 sections, it feels like a march towards the end - especially due to Bill's drums.

"Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's comin' 'round the bend
People runnin' 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no"

How does one feel when they can see their own end?

That guitar tone which comes in around 5.13 is forever etched in my brain. Thank you, Tony Iommi.

Also, as I'm new to researching papers in general, please let me know what resources you use (including AI) and how one can dive into research.

Let's move on to the next one.
