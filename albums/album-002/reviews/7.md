You will witness Tonny Iommi & Bill Ward in this song. Be prepared.

If you listen to a lot of other bands like Pink Floyd and you like this heavier subgenre as well, you can kind of notice that the soundscapes are similar even though they sound completely different. Not sure how many will agree with me.

I quite like that deeper hit around 0:14.

Remember how we talked about the topic of connected consciousness and the Lovecraft story in "Behind the Wall of Sleep"? This song in a way can expand on it. While this is a sad love song, I want to explore more about our connection with nature and our environments in general.

"And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan"

When Ozzy seems to be meet a girl for the first time, the environment around him becomes all dark and gloomy warning about her. So, there are 2 things I can think of:
1. The environment seems to notice and understand human emotion. The other way around is also true. However, the one thing that is clear is that the environment can see ahead. How else would it know to warn Ozzy? Or is it just that the environment can sense something else that we can't?
2. The environment is always conscious?

In the Lovecraft story, the environment around the narrator was part of an entity. That can also support these 2 points above.

"'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man"

So this same connected consciousness seems to exist in the "dreaming" realm as well. It is able to communicate with Ozzy in his dreams.

Does this mean that there are 2 types of consciousness and an ever present third consciousness as well which has access to both the physical realm and the dream realm but we as humans are only witnesses to it all? Or does this mean that we are also one of these entities and are like the travellers through space and time like in the Lovecraft story? Interesting thing to think about.

1.30 - Tonny Iommi greets you. Does it not feel like some sort of a cryptic conversation? I think this is one of the reasons why I appreciate sound so much. When you think about anything, sound adds this dimension that just makes the world around you feel complete.

"Now, the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known"

The environment keeps moving around but this time Ozzy can experience something else as well. A property of his, i.e, his voice, seems to be submitting to the effects of the environment around him. The woman herself states that they need to part.

3.21 - Tony Iommi greets you again.

Also, Bill fucking Ward.

Love how Butler chimes in at the halfway mark.

As we are halfway through the song, and especially after this solo section, we need to appreciate the band here. Bill Ward always has so much energy! Butler is entrusted with the groove. He commands it so well.

This groovy new section is so good. Tony keeps on grooving with his guitar and the rest of the band is right there with him, following his tunes.

5.10 - Yes, Fairies Wear Boots (3.14) :D

Frankly, living your life like Ozzy Osbourne sounds so thrilling. He even got to go out on his own terms. It was an adventorous one for sure.

That low pitched screech that you can here with notes from 6.20 onwards sound like dying people in a way. Like the sounds you used to hear when you killed the zombies in "The House Of The Dead". This game and "Conflict: Desert Storm" were the first games I ever played on a PC back in my childhood. Fun times.

There's this reverb sound looming around in the soundscape, suppressed during the solo. It comes to life around 6.57 when the pace is picked up and the reverb is very noticable.

This whole section is so soothing. It again makes you feel like you're floating through space. Imagine the sound echoing through space (it's a vacuum, I know) as you float around.

I don't know if it's something with the recording that I have but I feel like the part that comes at 8.08 (when the heavier guitar tone comes in) was stitched together with this song. You can hear the difference in the audio levels. Do let me know if I'm correct.

That heavier sound with that reverb works so well. It's like going "boo". 

Then you're hit with that chord at 8.57. It sounds like something just barked.

The sequence of tempo and scale drops starting from 9.06 onwards is so cool!

I think the song overall is such an experience.

Have you realised you have been listening to a 10.5 minute song?

Thank you, Black Sabbath.
