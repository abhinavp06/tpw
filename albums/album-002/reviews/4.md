It's time to hop back into our realm.
<br/><br/>
```"Oh, yeah
 Some people say my love cannot be true
 Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
 I will give you those things you thought unreal
 The sun, the moon, the stars, all bear my seal"```
<br/><br/>
You should google Nibby and Bill Ward together.
<br/><br/>
The song is about the devil falling in love.
<br/><br/>
I think this is kind of like a "fun" and "edgy" attempt of BS trying to look dark. This again brings me back to the range and talent that this band has. You have the initial song which is from the POV of a mere mortal and you have this which is from the POV of the devil himself.
<br/><br/>
In the initial song,
<br/><br/>
```"What is this that stands before me?
 Figure in black which points at me"```
<br/><br/>
The devil is seen as this monstrous entity.
<br/><br/>
However in this song, the devil appears to be a manipulator who uses his charm exceptionally well. As the song goes on you realise how dangerous he really is.
<br/><br/>
For people who are hearing Black Sabbath for the first time while reading this, I hope you're enjoying it. These guys created heavy metal, doom metal and much more. They created a new sound altogether. They were also only around 20-21 when they created this masterpiece. That is very young.
<br/><br/>
Butler apparently saw a figure from the dark side at the foot of his bed one night. Ozzy then composed the lyrics and that is how we got the first iconic song - Black Sabbath.
<br/><br/>
This album in fact was recorded in a single session. Imagine that. After this masterpiece, they released their next album "Paranoid" in the same year. Two back to back masterpieces.
<br/><br/>
This song is very nice on it's own but in combination with the first song makes this even better.
<br/><br/>
In the guitar solo, the dual guitar tone is so fun to listen to. The notes go so well together.
