Such a good cover of Crow's Evil Woman. You can hear the Black Sabbath twist to it.

You can visualize the waves created by the cymbal's sound. It's like a sine graph. I like the way they added the kicks in this song from the right and the cymbals from the left.

Butler is so elegant in his approach. The right amount of notes played with such precision.

When I was learning about the states of matter for the first time, a question that I asked was "What makes water wet?". How does a property exist in our world?

Do this if you have the time: Fill a bowl full of really small thermocol balls and dig your hand in it. You can feel the distance between the individual balls. Now imagine this on an even bigger scale. Imagine filling a bathtub. Now you may feel some of this "liquidity". Now scale down the size of those balls and fill more of them. As you keep decreasing the size and increasing the quantity, you will start to see a state of matter you are familiar with - liquid. 

While I can visualize this state of matter, the thing that I struggle to comprehend is the "wetness". Is it a separate property on it's own?

It is just like colour. Why is red "red"? Why is it that a colour is absolute? Sure, you can call red yellow, but the question will still remain the same. How is it that what we perceive always has a property to be perceived? Does this mean that we are limited to our perception - both mentally and visually?

Sometimes I wonder when we reach the point of AGI, will such questions be answered?
