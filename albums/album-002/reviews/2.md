```"Misty morning, clouds in the sky
 Without warning, a wizard walks by
 Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
 Long grey cloak, twinkling bell

 Never talking
 Just keeps walking
 Causing his magic"```
<br/><br/>
The guitar reminds me of Helmet's guitar tone in their "Meantime" album ("Give It" from the album).
<br/><br/>
There is a wizard walking by Ozzy who's "waving his spell" and is dressed in a grey cloak. He does not speak and just keeps on walking on his path. I read about this and it seems that the wizard is "Gandalf". That's quite fun. Somewhere it also says it's about a drug dealer.
<br/><br/>
There seem to be similarities between this song and Led Zeppelin's sound in a way.
<br/><br/>
```"Evil power disappears
 Demons worry when the wizard is near
 He turns tears into joy
 Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

 Never talking
 Just keeps walking
 Causing his magic"```
<br/><br/>
```"Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
 All the people give a happy sigh
 He has passed by, giving his sign
 Left all the people feeling so fine

 Never talking
 Just keeps walking
 Spreading his magic"```
<br/><br/>
Very basic in terms of lyrics (or are they?). It's such a fun song in contrast to the first one. In the first two songs itself, Sabbath show their musical range. How can someone possibly criticise anything on this album? It's so difficult. From the "twirling" guitar sound which comes in from one side to the constant heavy guitar on the other to Bill Ward going absolutely nuts on the drums. Butler as usual keeping everything tight yet emotional and of course Ozzy's dreamy vocals. There is absolutely nothing wrong in anything they create. You want instrumentals? They've got it. You want lyrical depth? They've got it. You want to feel something? You bet they've got it.
<br/><br/>
You can also relate these lyrics to learned spiritual individuals who seem to just spread so much positivity. Think of them like portals which radiate energy from a different realm. It seems that there is a single entity which can help you achieve happiness. Obviously, for some people this tends to be God - but does this mean that God is part of a different realm where there are more Gods?
<br/><br/>
Everyone worships someone different yet somehow the feeling experienced is the same.
<br/><br/>
Why is it that the amount of happiness one receives by experiencing this blissful state of mind much higher than what one receives by being told about this "happiness" itself? What is an "experience"?
<br/><br/>
Genius.
