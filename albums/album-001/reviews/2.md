Easily being one of the most well-known Alice in Chains songs, this is a very good choice when it comes to introducing someone to Alice in Chains. I love Sean's drums (especially the snare. It is engrained in my brain) in the intro. I think Jerry and Rex's guitars sound pretty fun. Nice, simple tempo. Then you get introduced to Layne who takes your hand slowly and keeps pushing you up and then drops you in the first breakdown. The bassline was so simple yet euphoric when I heard it for the first time. After the first breakdown you recover and then you're introduced to the same thing all over again, except this time Layne is dropping from you from an even higher place. I really dig the dual vocal setup. Plus, the main riff has some similarities to "I Can't Remember".
<br/><br/>
Let's dive a little deeper into the lyrics:
<br/><br/>
```"I'm the man in the box
 Buried In My Shit"
```
<br/>
2 gloomy yet very important lines. This will basically set the tone for Layne's legacy in a twisted way. In my opinion, coming to a realization that you have pushed yourself in a bottomless hole is a very tough job to do. Unfortunately every man has to fend for themselves, which means we have become accustomed to portraying ourselves as tough as possible. People sometimes are quite intrigued by how tough other people are, and even funnier, how tough they are themselves yet they live in ignorance. It's also obvious that Layne has accepted he is already dead (well, metaphorically). He has already realised that he is dead and there is no salvation now. Atleast until God rescues him.
<br/><br/>
Anyways,
<br/>
```"Won't you come and save me?"
 Save Me"```
<br/><br/>
This is obviously a cry to God (which is further proved by the chorus). It's quite funny to know that so many people turn to God whenever they're at their lowest. While my beliefs are a bit hazy, I must say seeking comfort under God is pretty cool. Do humans tend to fall or rather devote themselves to this amazing concept of an entity (I will not talk about God's existence. I think there is a force which will let you know it's presence when it wants to - and it's a great feeling according to me) because putting your trust on someone larger than you is our nature in itself? Many a times you have spilt your guts out to someone you love or your best friend - even more fun when you're drunk btw - because you find comfort in them. Your struggles somehow feel easier to strike through when you shed the load from your mind. Cheesy, I know, but yes, I really do think God is all around us. A friend is always larger than your sunken mind. When the mind reaches out to the top and is finally heard by someone, the friend arrives and lifts you up. It still is you who needs to be mentally strong, but your friend is definitely trying their hardest to pull you up. Go share something with someone today. It's a nice feeling.

<br/><br/>
Okay, let's get back to it.
<br/><br/>
Now, the chorus.
<br/><br/>
```"Feed my eyes
 (Can you sow them shut)
 Jesus Christ
 (Deny your maker)
 He who tries
 (Will be wasted)
 Oh, feed my eyes
 (Now you've sown them) shut"```
<br/><br/>
As I try to decipher the meaning behind this part, I have many analogies running through my head. Perhaps, that is such a nice thing to experience. I can think of around 10s of analogies yet you only get to read about 1 :) - funny how I was just talking about sharing something and now I'm gatekeeping - Yeah, I think the most basic analogy is that Layne's vocals are the cries for help and Jerry's vocals represent the "darkness" inside you. Corny, I know. I think the better thing to focus at this point in the song is the soundscape. You feel like an observer where you're watching Layne and Jerry fight each other as Layne cries to Jesus while the bass guitar and drums feel like your heartbeat. Oh can I say it again? I LOVE the bass line. It feels like you're hopping on stones a lava pit as you're watching the scene. Hot, hot, hot!
<br/><br/>
```"I'm the dog who gets beat
Shove my nose in shit
Won't you come and save me?
Save me"```
<br/><br/>
You know what, I always thought that this is like Layne suddenly taunting Jesus. Like, "Hey Jesus, I'm literally brurying my nose in shit? Will you come and save me?" (I want you to remember this as you read along). You can kind of feel this when it comes to the second breakdown. The vocals don't seem like cries but more of a authoritative tone (more energetic - now I know could have analysed this as the cries getting louder, but that's not fun is it?)
<br/><br/>
We have finally completed half of the song.
<br/><br/>
Post the second chorus:
<br/><br/>
Now I asked you to remember the taunts in the previous section. The reason is because of Jerry's solo and how the chorus is sung afterwards. When you listen to the solo, it feels cryptic. It's like Jesus just spoke (also, the voicebox adds so much more weight to this analogy). If you don't believe me listen to it carefully. I'll wait.
<br/><br/>
I know, right? Did it not feel like that? This was a clear response from Jesus to the taunt that Layne just made. Then you have a heavier riff while the lead has a lot of reverb (yet it's sharp - like you can trace where the reverb is heading to. It's like a line that is moving around.). It's like God's doing circles around you and then it drops! The final cry for help while Jerry's vocals get louder (or they seem to be). It's now upto you, you're being pulled up by Jesus. Will you fight?
<br/><br/>
Btw, if you're not shouting along by the third chorus with Layne, what is wrong with you?
<br/><br/>
Some little things I noticed (this is like the best way I can describe how the soundscapes feel):
<br/><br/>
I really like the way the "E"s are pronounced. Very elongated and deep sounding. You can feel how the sound ends up curving down as he finishes those "E"s. Also, the guitar during the chorus is nice. It's like you have 2 sources setup. One on the left and one on the right. Whenever, a sound is generated, it moves in a criss-cross angle (kinda like a 45 degree). The right moves to the left - a bunch of rays - and the left rays move to the right. The snare has this circular impact whenever it's hit. You know how like how you throw a stone from top-down into some water and there's this circular splash - even better, ripples. Yeah, that's kind of how the snare feels. The reverb probably has something to do with it. The bass as I described already feels like stepping stones. Like you're running around trying to not fall in the lava, or if I may, the box (ba dum tsss).
<br/><br/>
This should have been the album opener. What a shame.
