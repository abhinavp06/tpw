No you're not listening to some West Coast hip hop sample haha.

Pretty much the same thing as "Put You Down" and "Sunshine".

I also feel like the vocal is too separated from the instrumental in this song. It's like the vocal is layered on top of the instrumentals and was added later. I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion, but yeah.

Lyrics are also quite childish.

Don't really know what they were trying to achieve here.
