Alice in Chains is a band that I listen to daily. I thought the best way to kick off this blog would be to start with their debut album as it would act like a symbol of growth. I think my idea for this blog is to roam around and listen to many artists but also come back to these artists and try to relate their musical growth with myself.

While I don't think this is their best album, I really enjoy it!

Let's move on to the first song.
