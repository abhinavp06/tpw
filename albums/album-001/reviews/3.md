After witnessing the intensity of "Man In The Box", "Sea of Sorrow" is in contrast quite "slower". You want to know why Facelift is not a masterpiece? It is because of the tracklist. In my opinion, the tracklist is what brings this album down. They set the mood perfectly with "Man In The Box" but then they suddenly move away from it and choose a "happier" soundscape even though the lyrics are not happy. It just irks me - doesn't really feel right (although the starting notes in the intro does have some similarities with the previous song's intro which kind of reduces the harshness of the transition).

With that being said, "Sea of Sorrow" is not a bad song at all. It's really nice. You get to hear Jerry fuck around with his guitar during the solo again in a similar way to the previous song but with a different tone and a few changes here and there. It's a pretty nice section of the song. Also, the dual vocal layers in "As you wallow, In a sea of sorrow" are very harmonic.

"Mind of destructive taste
I choose to stroll amongst the waste
That was your heart, lost in the dark
Call off the chase
Walls of thought, strong and high
As my castle crumbles with time
I think of you, oh, yes I do
Such a crime
You opened fire and your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire"

First of all, the snares after "You opened fire" are so hollow. They literally feel like one of those spacetime fabric renders where there's an object in the middle which is pulling the fabric down, elongating it from the bottom. Sean Kinney is an amazing drummer. I think whenever I focus on this album a lot in the search of a "deeper meaning", the snares contribute a lot to the environment.

The lyrics basically convey how someone is trying to fall in love with someone who's toxic. The person approaching seems quite innocent and the one being approached seems to be a black figure - absolutely hollow. This is confirmed by the line "That was your heart, lost in the dark" - dark obviously doesn't mean the colour "black" like I mentioned but you get the point. The person seems to beg the hollow person to call of the chase and I suppose, to let them in. This can also be perceived as calling of the chase by rejecting this person so that they're free and don't lead them on.

The person seems to have built a castle of love and happy thoughts with them yet it is crumbling with time by realizing that the love is not being received. The person understands that the one they approached is toxic and tells them that "You deceived me and took advantage of my innocence ("smiling skull")".

"I live tomorrow
You, I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow"

The person finally gets up, packs their bags and leaves. They won't run behind this hollow person anymore. They're done. Let them stay in their darkness - I have nothing to do with it.

The part where the bass chimes in at 2.22 is so fun. I think Mike's subtelty and variation makes him a solid bass player.

"Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace, I'll never know
How far to go to reach that place"

I always think of how the "how far to go" line feels like a curved staircase going upwards because of the bass. Which kind of makes sense when you think about it with the context of the song. I'm up here being all innocent and you're down there being a "low-life". I love the combination 

Now let's focus on the solo. I fucking love that quick 7 chord progression (where the last chord wanders of into the abyss) at 3.52-3.54. Beautiful. It's just so satisfying. I also like how the solo opens up. However, the second half of the solo doesn't seem that great in comparison to the first half. I feel like we could have had something better. 

The bass line feels like little pellets being shot from a BB gun.

I also like the heavier tone which is introduced around 5.24.

Solid song. Dig the vibe.

Rating: 3.8/5
