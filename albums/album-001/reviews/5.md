The song that introduced me to Alice In Chains. I remember after a party, when I went home, smoked a joint and started listening to the usual Pantera, Tool, Helmet mix. Then all of a sudden this song pops up. Never heard a voice like this (The soundscape produced by everyone else was something that I appreciated more and more as I frantically searched for the band on Google and learned about their history - but man, Layne was SOMETHING). This song will always be the reason why I love Alice In Chains.
<br/><br/>
```"Turn around, you say
 'Scuse the 'tude but I haven't eaten today
 And my eyes are turning grey
 (What's your name?)
 I can't remember
 I can't remember"```
<br/><br/>
There is a world out there in the universe where there's always a bully and the one who gets beat. Oh wait, that's ours. I think this is a feeling that this intro conveys so well. Let me paint a picture for you.
<br/><br/>
Red skies all around, you are sitting on a bench. You see nothing around you. Its just dustry winds all around. You then see this huge black blob appear. It has sharp teeth, a face that's just so ugly. You all of a sudden look below and see a frail man, in a loincloth, crying with his left arm covering his forehead. The black blob taunts (the lyrics). It's on a hunt. It mocks the man, "You're asking me to turn around? Ha! I haven't eaten all day. You are my meal and I'm becoming a corpse since I haven't been fed". The amount of power this negative force has on this poor man is unbelievable. 
<br/><br/>
Now the last 2 lines can be interpreted in two ways:
<br/><br/>
1. The what's your name is asked by the blob and the poor man cries saying he doesn't remember his own name (either a desperate lie or he is broken down with no hope of bringing him back)
2. The black blob who seems to hunt regularly encounters numerous people everyday (kinda contradicting to how he's so powerful and meets people everyday but hasn't eaten all day for some reason) and just asks the man who he is? He seems to have encountered this man before but doesn't remember.
<br/><br/>
Now, in my opinion both these analogies fit together to form the perfect meaning. You can split the "I Can't Remember" into Layne and Jerry (the two vocal layers that you hear on the left and right side of your ear"). The universe where you pick Layne means you picked the side where Layne is new and has enough energy in him to still say that I can't remember - but hey, I can speak. I still have energy in me. The universe where you pick - nah nevermind this does not fit.
<br/><br/>
Yeah, it's just Layne (what you have just witnessed is me overanalysing things - it's fun sometimes). He seems to be new but the blob is a regular in this red, sandy landscape. The man is meeting the blob for the first time. While he is obviously overpowered, he is still new and this is proved by the powerful first "drop".
<br/><br/>
```"I can't
 Remember identity
 the visions in my mind from screamin' at me
 And mama, mama, ooh
 my angry brains of infancy"```
<br/><br/>
Pure fucking euphoria when I heard this for the first time (I was really high at the time as I mentioned above). My god. THIS is Layne Staley. 
<br/><br/>
The vision is the man's doom right in front of him. The blob does not actually exist outside but inside him. The problem with this analogy is it's too boring and feels very "philosophical" - IRONY, I know - but yeah. I like to look at it like it's a battle that I as a third party am witnessing.
<br/><br/>
All the man remembers is his mother. He feels like a kid. Helpless. He can only go cry to mommy. This is such a good way to convey the mockery that this man is being subjected to. Amazing lines.
<br/><br/>
BTW, for some reason, whenever you hear the extended "y" and the "oo" after the "infancy" you can picture Layne smiling like he knows he just killed that vocal delivery. Like you can picture him in the studio leaning back as the ends that "y" and nodding his head vibing to the instrumentals.
<br/><br/>
```"Knocked down but I have enough hate to breathe
 Down your throat and steal your energy
 You took everything but my will to be
 Now the loss of your God won't make me bleed"```
<br/><br/>
I like to think of this as Layne talking from both sides but the voice remains same since the blob is becoming one with Layne. The first line is Layne shouting that "I may be knocked down, but I can still fight!" and then the blob responds - reaching for him - "I'm going to drain all your energy out" - and then Layne shouts back that "You will take everything but my will to be. I am still alive" - but then the blob responds "Now the loss of your God won't make me bleed" - as in "I have finished devouring you. I have taken your God - your will to live - and I don't care about your cries. You're just another meal". The solo after that is a dusty cloud that covers them both for a while and then all of a sudden the cloud dissapears but so does the man.
<br/><br/>
Even the vocal after the "bleed" has the same effect as the one we heard in "infancy".
<br/><br/>
Now you may have noticed I missed the second lyrical block of this song. Well, not really. Now that you have read the analogy above, this one will make more sense.
<br/><br/>
```"Bring me down, you try
 Feel the pain and keep it all in 'til you die
 Without eyes you cannot cry
 (Who's to blame?)
 I can't remember"```
<br/><br/>
It's again the fight between Layne and the blob. The blob here is taunting Layne by telling him to feel the pain when he consumes him and tells him to bury himself in it till he dies. I will gouge your eyes out and you wont even be able to cry. Who's to blame? Well, I can't remember - as in "Hmm, I wonder who's to blame for this?" as the blob puts it's right hand on it's chin. Pure mockery is what this poor man is being subjected to. It makes you feel sorry for the man. What went so wrong with his life?
<br/><br/>
Now, back to the ending of the song.
<br/><br/>
```"I
I
I am alive"```
<br/><br/>
Yeah, the cloud and the man dissapeared, but all of a sudden you hear the man's last cry as it echoes through the place you have been teleported to with the dusty winds engulfing you and preparing you for the end - still in denial or just still full of will - he screams that he is alive, yet too bad. He is now dead. Then, that's it. It just ends in a flash and you are teleported out of that landscape and are transported to the next landscape. Facelift is a trip man. Amazing album. On the surface it can seem like a man bitching about his depression but I think when you sit and try to think of this album as a journey - which is how any album should be - it holds up pretty well.
<br/><br/>
Now, there are many things this blob can represent. It's a shame that there are too many things which can consume you as you drown. Drugs, obviously being one. Quite frankly, it can be the cheesiest thing such as love or money or greed but also more complex like your mind itself.
<br/><br/>
Soundscapes:<br/>
Very gloomy and windy (which is emphasised by the tempo and the lead). When you get to the first chorus it's like you're being taken somewhere. The bass is very important here (especially the parts around 1.10-1.27) - it emphasises the "doom" even more - along with the reverb on Layne's vocals in some parts. Overall, the vocals are very powerful and seem very concise and well calculated. I never feel like the higher pitch is crossing it's boundaries. It's the perfect amount - along with the rasp of course. Love that drum sequence before the solo.
<br/><br/>
Great song.
