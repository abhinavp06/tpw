You should listen to this song after Bleed The Freak. It will make you appreciate this pair of songs a lot. It's like the continuation to how Layne goes on a hunt to catch people who have wronged him. You now have Layne holding his victim by his chin as the person is down.
<br/><br/>
Now, you may not agree with this analysis and say that this is also a song about abusive relationships. Sure. However, this pairing is just so much more fun. It kind of gives this "witness my darker side" vibe a lot better compared to the regular abusive relationship meaning.
<br/><br/>
Lyrically, it's pretty basic. I think the emphasis on this song should be more on how Layne sings them (yet another "Layne was SOMETHING" moment). One of the best vocal performances in AiC history for sure.
<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, I think the solo is underwhelming which stops it from being a 5/5 song. I know, I know, I said that thing about Jerry in the "Bleed The Freak" review and this kind of also nullifies my "pair of songs" approach in some way, but it is what it is.

This is the best song from the second half according to my tracklist.
