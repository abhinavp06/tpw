          <p><strong>--- 01-09-2025 20:34 MONDAY ---</strong></p>
          <p>
            You know how when you're in your early 20's you start thinking about
            a lot of things? You feel like you're this deeply enlightened person
            and you think that you know a lot. This blog was something that I
            felt would be a way to convey my naive thoughts as well. I had an
            idea for quite some time and finally decided to just execute it.
          </p>
          <p>  
            What started as just a fun way to document my philosophical findings 2 months ago, has eventually evolved into a full-fledged mindmap.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm going to keep it very simple and to the point as I'm writing this introduction for the 3rd time.
          </p>
          <p><strong>What is "The Philosopher's Window"?</strong></p>
          <p>
            <em>"The Philosopher's Window"</em> was a fun title I came up with
            while following my usual late night routine of sitting at the
            platform near my bedroom window and just thinking about life while I
            listened to music.
          </p>
          <p><strong>What's up with the horrible UI?</strong></p>
          <p> I don't know. I just thought it'll make me look like a nerd.</p>
          <p>It's not responsive either. The best way to "experience" this blog is on a desktop.</p>
          <p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
          <p>Professionally, I'm a Software Engineer and an Architect.</p>
          <p> I love to think about almost anything. I have been interested in the field of consciousness studies for the last 7 years. It is absolutely mind blowing.</p>
          <p>I'm also a huge music and movie nerd (atleast I like to think I am one). I've been collecting music and movies for as long as I can remember. While I don't play any instrument (which is very surprising), I really understand the field of music. Analysing music is a hobby of mine. I also like to mix music with my Pioneer DDJ RB once in a while.</p>
          <p>I'm also a sane person. All timestamps are in the DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM DAY format. Anytime you see a timestamp means that the following text was written at that time. </p>
          <p><strong>What's the goal of this blog?</strong></p>
          <p>While the goal of this blog has evolved in the last 2 months since it's inception, this is basically a mindmap of all my thoughts. I wanted a way to document my mental growth. You will understand as I explain what each section of the blog is for. Think of this as a bunch of hobbies grouped into a
          single blog.
          </p>
          <p>
          I wanted to document my findings somewhere so that the readers, yes, you, can help me in my journey as well along with me introducing you to some good music. It has been my medium of choice for self-expression and exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal here is to dive deeper into "the greater meaning of life". I
            have been fascinated by the existence of consciousness, the self and
            God for a long time.
          </p>
          <p>We'll also use AI to research about topics together and document our findings.</p>
          <p><strong>Explain the different sections of the blog</strong></p>
          <p>
            This blog has 4 sections: ALBUMS, BLOGS, NOTES, and TYLI.
          </p>
          <p>
          <p><strong>Explain the "Albums" section</strong></p>
          <p>This is where it all started. </p>
          <p>
          This section is basically a "listen, read and think along" exercise. Each album review is not actually a review of the album but a literal documentation about my philosophical findings and other fun things I'm doing on a day to day basis.
          </p>
          <p>
          Think of these "reviews" as conversations as the music plays.
          </p>
          <p>
          Basically, you're supposed to listen to the album while reading it's review. This is not a musical analysis blog but more of a "I like to listen to music and think" blog.
          </p>
          <p>
          As I stated earlier, I've been analysing music for years but I don't play any instrument. I don't talk a lot about the technicalities of instrumentals because I'm not that well versed with technicalities. I understand music a lot and emphasise a lot on technicalities while listening as well but unfortunately, I cannot convey them in a format that is readable (I try my best to put it in words - most of the time this can be more of a "it sounds like this/that" or "it feels/looks like this/that" kind of a thing).
          </p>
          <p>Majority of these reviews will have metal albums as that is the genre I primarily listen to. However, I listen to almost anything, so expect to see other genres as well.</p>
          <p>The review is divided into 3 sections: pre-review, tracklist and review.</p>
          <p>ALWAYS READ THE PRE-REVIEW FIRST!! Then read each track's review and then finally you can "unlock" the review :D</p>
          <p><strong>Explain the "Blogs" section</strong></p>
          <p>If I ever want to just write, I'll post something here.</p>
          <p><strong>Explain the "Notes" section</strong></p>
          <p>This section contains notes that I write before writing an album review. It will most likely contain a list of topics I want to explore in that review and any other things I want to focus on. Think of it like a "behind the scenes" for a review.</p>
          <p><strong>Explain the "TYLI" section</strong></p>
          <p>Yeah, this is just a weird experiment. Go to <a href="https://tpw.co.in/tyli-article.html?tyli=tyli/tyli-001">tyli-001</a> to understand what it's about.</p>
          <p><strong>Okay, cool. Now what?</strong></p>
          <p>
            If you have made it this far, congratulations! You have a normal
            attention span and will likely enjoy my creation.
          </p>
          <p>Please go to the "Albums" section to start reading my reviews (start with the 3rd review - <a href="https://tpw.co.in/album-review.html?album=albums%2Falbum-003"> Aenima</a>. The first 2 reviews are just me experimenting).</p>
          <p>There might be typos here and there but I'm too lazy to fix them.</p>
          <p>I hope you enjoy your journey!</p>
