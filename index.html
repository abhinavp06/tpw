        <p><strong>---15-07-2025 20:51 TUESDAY---</strong></p>
        <p>
          You know how when you're in your early 20's you start thinking about a
          lot of things? You feel like you're this deeply enlightened person and
          you think that you know a lot. This blog was something that I felt
          would be a way to convey my naive thoughts as well. I had an idea for
          quite some time and finally decided to just execute it.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, as I write this introduction, on
          <strong>15th July 2025 at 20:51</strong>, I have already reviewed 2
          songs - <em>"Man In The Box"</em> and <em>"I Can't Remember"</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been collecting music since the age of 10. I am 23 now (will
          turn 24 soon) as I write this. It has been a long journey and my
          collection has kept evolving. After almost 14 years of listening to
          music (I listen to a lot of genres), I found out that I listen
          to Rock & Metal the most. I unfortunately ended up diving too deep
          into these genres and it's quite hard to think of something else
          becoming part of my routine. I still enjoy any genre to ever exist but
          the guitars, drums, screams and the soulful vocals in metal and rock
          seem to be irreplaceable. As I have been collecting music all my life,
          I have lost my hard disks and pendrives which had a lot of albums a
          few times. I am now getting back into building my library again but at
          the same time I am also growing my music taste. It is endless and I
          hope to do this for as long as possible. Also, I have just started
          getting into research as well due to the AI wave.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had at some point also decided to do this with movies. However, at
          this point I think I am better off with music.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Coming to the name.</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>"The Philosopher's Window"</em> was a fun title I came up with
          while following my usual late night routine of sitting at the platform
          near my bedroom window and just thinking about life while I listened
          to music. Think of these "reviews" being conversations as the music
          plays. I will also try to include research on thoughts I come up with.
          Think of this as a bunch of hobbies grouped into a single blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal here is to dive deeper into "the greater meaning of life". I have been
          fascinated by the existence of consciousness, the self and God for a long time.
          I wanted to document my findings somewhere so that the readers, yes, you, can help
          me in my journey as well along with me introducing you to some good music. 
          It has been my medium of choice for self-expression and exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I want you to understand a few things before you dive into my
          collection of albums:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What you read is what I'm thinking of at that instant. Analogies may
            not line up sometimes when it comes to tying an album together or
            even within a song. I am literally writing out my thoughts. This is
            not a "musical analysis" blog but more of a "I really enjoy
            listening to music and thinking about things" blog. I am quite self
            aware about how corny this can get, but corny is fun. As far as the
            analogies go, I listen to each song at least 5-10 times (and a full
            album can take me at least a week or two depending on my day to day
            schedule) as I write these reviews which is why my mind can wander
            off (which will become quite evident as you start reading them).
            It's a little contradictory when you take into the "conversational"
            aspect I am trying to achieve, but you get the point. In a way,
            these blogs are also research papers on their own.
          </li>
          <li>
            I recommend reading my "reviews" by following these steps:
            <ul>
              <li>Read the album pre-review first. Always.</li>
              <li>Read my analysis as you listen to the songs.</li>
              <li>
                Listen to the album again and try to find what part of the song
                seems to align with your analogies and what part of the song
                seems align with mine. Also, make sure to also emphasise
                listening more to the instruments as well. I tend to focus more
                on the lyrics when I write these blogs but I absolutely enjoy
                the instruments just as much. Soundscapes wouldn't exist without
                instrumentals.
              </li>
              <li>Read my final album review.</li>
              <li>
                Then listen to the songs in the order I think it should have
                been in if you feel like it.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            I don't talk a lot about the technicalities of instrumentals because
            I'm not that well versed with musical terms. I understand music a
            lot and emphasise a lot on technicalities while listening as well
            but unfortunately, I cannot convey them in a format that is readable
            (I try my best to put it in words - most of the time this can be
            more of a "it sounds like this/that" or "it feels/looks like
            this/that" kind of a thing).
          </li>
          <li>
            This is just pure fun. I am not a "deep thinker". I just like to
            dive deeper into songs because it makes me appreciate the art of
            sound itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may have landed here because someone told you about it (if I
            ever decide to publish all of this) or I just let you read these.
            Either way, I think a really good way to read my entire album
            collection (if I ever end up covering all the albums that I have -
            around 1219 as of now) is to read my blogs in the ascending order of
            the dates I created them. I will act as a companion and we will both
            grow together as we dive deep into music and life in general.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since it takes a lot of time to sit and review each song, I
            encourage you to focus more on the individuality of a song rather
            than the album reviews. I feel I can communicate better when the
            review context is limited to a single song. However, this is not
            always true. I sometimes may review a song based on how it fits on
            the album as a whole. It just depends on how I approach the song. I
            suppose the similar thing goes for my album ratings too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to the way I write these reviews, the ratings are not based on
            how good a song is within the artist's discography or how it
            performs against other songs in the genre but on how the song makes
            me feel. Just to remind you again - this is NOT a technicality
            backed approach but a human one.
          </li>
          <li>
            I see this as a long term experiment as well. I want to document my
            mental growth. The idea of my mind having its snapshots taken so
            that I can revisit them later really excites me. The fact that the
            mind in itself can exist in the past and the present at the same
            time is phenomenal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every review is a reflection of the state of mind at that moment and
            I think the beautiful thing about this is that there would have been
            worlds where the same person with the same mind would have written
            something different.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeating it once again - in my opinion, trying to imagine a
            conversation while you listen to these songs and read the reviews
            will be the best way for you to understand the goal of this blog.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you have made it this far, congratulations you have a normal
          attention span and will likely enjoy my creation.

        <p>I hope you enjoy your journey!</p>
