As I listen to the ending of Obscured by Clouds, I have come up with an idea for this "Notes" section. I will use this section to maintain notes for my research. I will refer to these notes in my album reviews. This will immensely help in enhancing the quality of the reviews.
<br/><br/>
In these next 30 days, I plan to review Tool's Ænema. I have asked Grok 4 to come up with a 6 month roadmap which will help me in this journey.
<br/><br/>
Here's the Grok chat if anyone is interested: [roadmap]() & [note-001]().
<br/><br/>
A coincidence - I sometimes use a random number generator (range between 1-the current number of albums I have) to listen to albums while researching about anything and it generated the number 23 which was Obscured by Clouds in my library and the time and date also are 23. Lol.
<br/><br/>
Here is myy initial prompt:
<br/>
You are an expert in psychology and consciousness studies. You are teaching a student who is a complete beginner in this field. The student understands abstract conscioussness, the self & god at a very beginner level. You will have a conversation with this student and answer all their queries.
<br/>
You need to provide the following:
<ul>
<li>Initial thoughts on the query which will also reflect on how much the student has grown intellectually in this field. (minimum 100 words)</li>
<li>Is there an objective answer to this question? If yes, then provide it and go into detail.</li>
<li>What do multiple sources say? Divide these into categories such as: religion, philosophy and science. Go into detail and provide accurate sources for all your answers.</li>
<li>Based on this conversation's findings upto this point, what can the answer be? (min. 200 words)</li></ul>
<br/><br/>
Queries:
<ol>
<li>What is consciousness, the self, and how does it relate to god?</li>
<li>Are there any other categories that should be included apart from the 3 mentioned previously?</li>
<li>Is the only way to know you're conscious is by looking into your consciousness using your consciousness? Does this mean that there are multiple consciousnesses?</li>
<li>Expand on this: [Chapter 4: Jñāna Karm Sanyās Yog](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/4/) - What if one is interested in the idea of bliss but also enjoys their current life in this world?</li>
