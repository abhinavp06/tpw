As I listen to the ending of Obscured by Clouds, I have come up with an idea for this "Notes" section. I will use this section to maintain notes for my research. I will refer to these notes in my album reviews. This will immensely help in enhancing the quality of the reviews.
<br/><br/>
In these next 30 days, I plan to review Tool's Ænema. I have asked Grok 4 to come up with a 6 month roadmap which will help me in this journey.
<br/><br/>
Here's the Grok chat if anyone is interested: [roadmap](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_2544abf1-a3c7-480b-b581-7b84059c5944) & [note-001](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_dcb7a8bd-763f-4bd5-88b6-2712107a6ac4).
<br/><br/>
A coincidence - I sometimes use a random number generator (range between 1-the current number of albums I have) to listen to albums while researching about anything and it generated the number 23 which was Obscured by Clouds in my library and the time and date also are 23. Lol.
<br/><br/>
Here is my initial prompt:
<br/>
You are an expert in psychology and consciousness studies. You are teaching a student who is a complete beginner in this field. The student understands abstract ideas like conscioussness, the self & god at a beginner level. You will have a conversation with this student and answer all their queries.
<br/>
You need to provide the following:
<ul>
<li>Initial thoughts on the query which will also reflect on how much the student has grown intellectually in this field. (minimum 100 words)</li>
<li>Is there an objective answer to this question? If yes, then provide it and go into detail.</li>
<li>What do multiple sources say? Divide these into categories such as: religion, philosophy and science. Go into detail and provide accurate sources for all your answers.</li>
<li>Based on this conversation's findings upto this point, what can the answer be? (min. 200 words)</li></ul>
<br/><br/>
Queries:
<ol>
<li>What is consciousness, the self, and how does it relate to god?</li>
<li>Are there any other categories that should be included apart from the 3 mentioned previously?</li>
<li>Is the only way to know you're conscious is by looking into your consciousness using your consciousness? Does this mean that there are multiple consciousnesses?</li>
<li>Expand on this: [Chapter 4: Jñāna Karm Sanyās Yog](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/4/) - What if one is interested in the idea of bliss but also enjoys their current life in this world?</li>
</ol>

<b> Chapter 5 Article Thoughts </b>
<br/><br/>
Article 4:
<ul>
<li>The term "proto-conscious"</li>
<li>"It also implies a graded model of consciousness, where the complexity of consciousness correlates with the number of potential states in a superposition."</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
Article 3:
<ul>
<li>"In particular, the modern scientific world view has it that all things are ultimately constituted of
fundamental, simple and purely physical entities which possess a relatively small number of basic
attributes such as mass, charge and spin. There is no place for and no need to postulate that these physical
building blocks have any mental properties whatsoever. And yet it is certain that some of the composite
objects – such as ourselves – made from quarks, electrons and the other fundamental physical entities do
exemplify mental properties. Therefore, the modern scientific viewpoint has to endorse some form of
emergentism."</li>
<li>"The first is to give a characterization of the mental which captures its essential mental aspect
without using the notion of consciousness. The second is to describe the relation between the unconscious
and conscious mental states, and this leads to fundamental problems which threaten to undercut the
supposed advantage that panpsychism has over emergentist views."</li>
<li>Alfred North Whitehead’s (1929) ‘process philosophy’</li>
<li>"For example, we say that an electron has a negative charge of
about 1.6  10
-19 coulombs, but what this means is that the electron is disposed to move in such-and-such
a way in an electric field of such-and-such a strength. The intrinsic nature of electric charge remains
utterly mysterious. And yet it seems reasonable to think that every dispositional property stems from
underlying intrinsic properties. Of these, with respect to the fundamental physical constituents of the
world, we know absolutely nothing, since physics deals only with the dispositional properties of matter.
This is a long standing position. Both Eddington and Russell, among others, agree that ‘science has
nothing to say as to the intrinsic nature of the atom’(Russell called the dispositional properties of matter
‘mathematical properties’). This led Eddington to assert further that we know nothing of atoms which
‘renders it at all incongruous that they should constitute a thinking object’ (1927, 259 [both quotations])
and to adopt a panpsychist understanding of matter."</li>
