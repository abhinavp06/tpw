As I listen to the ending of Obscured by Clouds, I have come up with an idea for this "Notes" section. I will use this section to maintain notes for my research. I will refer to these notes in my album reviews. This will immensely help in enhancing the quality of the reviews.
<br/><br/>
In these next 30 days, I plan to review Tool's Ã†nema. I have asked Grok 4 to come up with a 6 month roadmap which will help me in this journey.
<br/><br/>
Here's the Grok chat if anyone is interested: [roadmap]() & [note-001]().
<br/><br/>
A coincidence - I use a random number generator (range between 1-the current number of albums I have) to listen to songs while researching about anything and it generated the number 23 which was Obscured by Clouds in my library and the time and date also are 23. Lol.
