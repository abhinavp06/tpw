### Updated 6-Month Roadmap for Beginners in Psychology and Consciousness Studies

This revised roadmap incorporates perspectives from other religions to provide a more interfaith approach, building on the original foundations from Hinduism (Vedanta), Swami Vivekananda, and J. Krishnamurti. I've added insights from Buddhism (e.g., no-self and mindfulness), Christianity (e.g., divine grace and union with God), Islam (e.g., Tawhid/unity with Allah and Sufi mysticism), Judaism (e.g., divine presence and ethical self), Taoism (e.g., harmony with the Tao), and others where relevant. This enriches the exploration by showing common threads across traditions, such as non-duality and spiritual awareness, while highlighting unique emphases.

The structure remains over 6 months, with daily practices (1-2 hours: reading/reflection/meditation). Use a journal for insights. Progress gradually, adapting as needed.

For each step, I've ensured at least 5 research papers, drawing from academic sources on psychology, spirituality, and interfaith studies. Additional relevant sources include sacred texts, talks, and books from diverse religions.
