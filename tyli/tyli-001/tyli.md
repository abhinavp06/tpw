As I was writing my Aenima [review](https://tpw.co.in/album-review.html?album=albums%2Falbum-003), I got this idea to try to come up with a new language altogether which can explain consciousness.
<br/><br/>
It is widely accepted that mathematics is the language of the universe. I have this crazy idea to apply mathematics to the consciousness studies and philosophies that I come up with.
<br/><br/>
I have decided that as I write my reviews which cover my varied interests, the main component being philosophy and consciousness, I will try to "prove" them using math. How cool is that?
<br/><br/>
Of course, I may not succeed and in fact, this may just be a waste of time but who cares? Trying something stupid is the only way to discover something that has never been thought of before.
<br/><br/>
I'm going to name this new "language" TYLI. The goal of this language is to be "the theory of everything".
<br/><br/>
I was really into math and physics when I was studying for college. Unfortunately, it's been quite some time since I have solved a differential equation or worried about Newton's laws.
<br/><br/>
So, here's the deal: I'm going to spend more hours in a day getting back into math and physics. The philosophical findings will be present in my reviews. I will keep updating this file with some concrete findings backed by philosophy. These will serve as the founding statements of this new language. I will then use math and physics and any other branch of science to come up with proofs for the same.
<br/><br/>
Crazy? Sure. Is it possible? Who knows. However, the only thing that matters is to have fun and learn something new.
