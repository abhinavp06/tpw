# Sample TYLI Entry

This is a sample TYLI (Today You Learned, I...) entry to demonstrate the structure.

TYLI entries are meant to capture quick insights, learnings, or thoughts - similar to blogs but potentially more focused on specific learnings or realizations.

## Content Structure

TYLI entries can include:

- Quick insights
- Learning moments
- Philosophical observations
- Brief reflections

This format allows for flexible content that doesn't need to be as structured as full blog posts.
